The Debian Package libax25
----------------------------

This version is a modified version of the May 2023 GIT source
from https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de/wiki/Main_Page 

It re-arranges the source code in to proper directorys, updates to
current autotools, corrects build dependencies, and removes the
conf files from this package (moved to ax25-tools).

Until the modified source makes it into GIT, it will be available
from https://github.com/ve7fet/linuxax25 

***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need
the following additional packages installed:
        libtool
        dpkg-dev
        debhelper
        devscripts
        fakeroot
        lintian
        dh-make
        config-package-dev
        dh-exec

From inside the source folder (libax25), run the following:
        ./autogen.sh
        debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
        fakeroot debian/rules clean
        ./autogen.sh clean

Note, this source is multi-arch aware... you can build a package on a Pi
if you want to make armhf packages instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if
you like).
