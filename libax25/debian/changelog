libax25 (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  accidentally re-introduced during upstream source synchronization. Those
  man files belong in ax25-tools.

libax25 (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added versioning to the shared libs to differentiate the ones generated 
    by this source.
  * Revert a patch from the linux-ax25.org source to axutils.c (version 1.5) that 
    changed the behaviour of the ax25_ntoa function (breaking it). aton should 
    only convert the callsign, not modify it. Specifically, if the callsign has 
    a -0 SSID, DON'T DROP IT! This breaks existing software that does use -0! If 
    some program doesn't like SSID -0, then IT should be modified to drop it or do 
    whatever you want. The AX.25 spec says callsigns MUST have an SSID from 0-15. 
    The ax25_ntoa function strictly should perform the conversion to ascii, and 
    that is it.
