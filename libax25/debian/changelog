libax25 (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert the Debian packaging changes putting libraries into their
  own subfolder. Ldconfig isn't smart enough to find them, so the
  package is broken if we can't fidn the libraries after they are
  installed.

libax25 (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump the revision of the libax25 library to 1:1:0, since
  additional baud rates were added, and the source was changed,
  per GNU versioning guidelines.
  * Update Debian compatibility to version 13, changing some of the
  /debian files.
  * Fix some of the resulting Lintian warnings and errors.
  * Moved the installed location of the man pages.
  * Remove INSTALL file from being packaged, it isn't necessary for
  binary packages.
  * NOTE: This update moves the shared library files into their own
  /ax25 subfolder in /usr/lib (or equivalent), so that they don't
  pollute the root /usr/lib folder and longer.

libax25 (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update code with upstream patches and bug fixes from 2019 to
  2023-05-13.

libax25 (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update the Debian packaging files to compatibility level 10. Also
  fixed some of the package rules to put the right doc files in the
  right package.
  * Update the README with some better instructions for building from 
  source or building Debian packages.
  * Remove Makefile dependency/distribution of SVNREV, since we are
  not using it right now.
  * Fix the spec file so it will build an rpm.

libax25 (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new Debian packaging rules to fix the conflict with the header 
  files that are supplied with glibc (ax25.h, netrom.h, rose.h). Now 
  we will properly "divert" them to the ones supplied with this package, 
  and restore them if the package is removed. This allows the libax25-dev 
  package to properly install without conflicts and errors.

libax25 (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaging for Debian. 
  * Remove man pages for axports, rsports, and nrports that were
  accidentally re-introduced during upstream source synchronization. Those
  man files belong in ax25-tools.

libax25 (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating to bring codebase up to sync with official sources,
    will keep our file structure to make packaging easier
  * Already had most of the patches applied, some minor format changes 

 -- Bernard Pidoux <f6bvp@amsat.org>  Sat, 21 Oct 2017 16:00:00 -0800

libax25 (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Long overdue updating to bring codebase up to sync with official sources,
    will keep our file structure to make packaging easier
  * Already had most of the patches applied, some minor format changes 
  * Notes from official source indicate SSID -0 patch was reverted (yay!)

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Tue, 04 Nov 2014 14:30:00 -0800

libax25 (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify axutils.c to better detect and abort on an empty callsign,
    preventing a segfault (per F6BVP)

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Tue, 31 Jul 2012 14:00:00 -0800

libax25 (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Identified an installation issue. Add a note during install to remind 
    users to run ldconfig as root to update cache.

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Thu, 08 Sep 2011 19:30:00 -0800

libax25 (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added versioning to the shared libs to differentiate the ones generated 
    by this source.
  * Revert a patch from the linux-ax25.org source to axutils.c (version 1.5) that 
    changed the behaviour of the ax25_ntoa function (breaking it). aton should 
    only convert the callsign, not modify it. Specifically, if the callsign has 
    a -0 SSID, DON'T DROP IT! This breaks existing software that does use -0! If 
    some program doesn't like SSID -0, then IT should be modified to drop it or do 
    whatever you want. The AX.25 spec says callsigns MUST have an SSID from 0-15. 
    The ax25_ntoa function strictly should perform the conversion to ascii, and 
    that is it.

libax25 (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low
