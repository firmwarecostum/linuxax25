libax25 for Debian
------------------

This package will conflicts with some files found in libc6-dev. The offending
files are:
        netax25/ax25.h
        netrose/rose.h
        netrom/netrom.h

Those files belong to libax25, and as such, this package is marked to replace
them. Those files will be overwritten by the ones found in the libax25-dev
package.
