AX25 Library
============

This library is consistent with the official source, available at:
http://git.linux-ax25.org/cgit/libax25.git/ 
Master/head, up to patches applied on 2017-09-08. Verified 2018-08-11.

This library set is still really under test but is now released for
general use. 

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

To compile this I used:
  * A Mageia GNU/Linux system
  * autoconf 2.69
  * automake 1.15.1
  * libtool 2.4.6
  * Gnu C  5.4.0 (Mageia 5.4.0-5.mga6) 
  * Gnu make               4.1
  * Linux C Library        Dynamic linker (ldd)   2.22

Briefly, the shell command './autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install'
will install AX25 library
