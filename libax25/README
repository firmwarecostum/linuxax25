AX25 Library
============

This library is consistent with the official source, available at:
http://git.linux-ax25.org/cgit/libax25.git/ 
Master/head, up to patches applied on 2023-05-13. Verified 2023-08-01.

This library set is still really under test but is now released for
general use. 

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  

***Building from Source***

To build this package from a source tarball, you need the following:
	A GNU/Linux system
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool
	libc
	gcc

On a Debian/Ubuntu, or similar system, you would need at least the following 
packages:
	autotools-dev 
	autoconf 
	automake 
	libtool 
	zlib1g-dev 

Quick and dirty build, with all the defaults, can be accomplished with:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

This will typically install everything under /usr/local. If you want it 
installed elsewhere, see the INSTALL file for options you can pass to 
the ./configure script.


***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need 
the following additional packages installed:
	libtool 
	dpkg-dev 
	debhelper 
	devscripts 
	fakeroot 
	lintian 
	dh-make 
	config-package-dev 
	dh-exec

From inside the source folder (libax25), run the following:
	./autogen.sh
	debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
	fakeroot debian/rules clean
	./autogen.sh clean

Note, this source is multi-arch aware... you can build a package on a Pi 
if you want to make armhf packages instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if 
you like).
