ax25apps (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing the default conf file installation. Correct the file names and
  variable substitution.
  * Added better header file checking to configure script. Now aborts on
  missing headers.
  * Build call and listen against the ncursesw/curses.h header, they were
  being built against the generic curses.h.
  * Update Debian packaging files to compatibility level 10.

ax25apps (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Releasing this as version 2.0.0 as there are significant changes that
  may break compatibility with the version 1.x.x code, namely call now
  supports UTF-8, listen changed some of its options, and ax25ipd supports
  more baud rates.
  * Add files for Debian package building
  * Change the way the default conf files are installed. They will now be 
  put in somewhere like /usr/share/doc/ax25apps/conf with .dist extensions 
  to ensure that the default config files don't clobber working files
  * Synchronized our source tree with upstream official source patches
  current to 2017 (latest patch level). Summary of changes follow, but see
  the official source tree for further details.
  * Tree-wide changes:
      Remove useless initializations to 0 or NULL.
      Whitespace changes for consistency.
      Sort out variable and function declarations:
        Make static what can be made static.
        Add declaration where they were missing.
        Don't define variables in headers.
        Move declaations to the proper locations.
        Pick up declarations from the proper headers.
      Cleanup header file inclusion:
        We were including way too many system header files, some even multiple
        times and it wasn't immediately visible. Clean this.
        This also drops definitions of __USE_XOPEN which never had the desired
        effect with glibc.
  * listen:
      Change behaviour, now -t option disables timestamps (timestamps are
      enabled by default, without -t).
      Remove useless postincrement op. GCC would have done that itself but now
      the code is slightly less eyesore. Broken out from a patch by Wietse
      Ruyg <pe1oez@dds.nl>.
      Remove code controlled by NEW_AX25_STACK.
      Fix overzealous GCC 7 compiler warnings.
  * call:
      UTF-8 support for call. Patch by Cathryn Mataga.
        1. Now supports UTF8 or IBM850 as the encoding style over AX25.
        1a. Attention was paid to make sure that wide characters worked
        with East Asian fonts.
        2. Now the screen can be resized correctly. The program no longer
        crashes when it is resized.
        3. Added a scrollback buffer. Use the up and down arrow keys or the
        page up/page down keys to scroll through history. After the screen
        begins scrolling, press 'up arrow' to view history.
        4.  Many visual quirks have been fixed.
      THIS VERSION IS NOW DEPENDENT ON iconv AND WIDE CHARACTER VERSIONS OF
      ncurses (ie libncursesw5-dev).
      Fix buffer overflow. When sending files of 1GB or larger, size_buffer
      was not large enough to hold the number including a trailing \0.
      Fix structure mismatch
      GCC with LTO enabled warn. This was caused by different .c files
      being built with different libc feature selection macros.
      Harden against compiler overoptimization. A compiler won't know that
      the interrupted variable can be changed behind its back in a signal
      handler so it might do clever overoptimizations.
      Fix declaration of unix2yapp(). It didn't match the actual function
      definition.
      Don't reinstall SIGQUIT signal handler. This is Linux software so we
      don't have to deal with this kind of UNIX V7 or SVR3 braindamage of
      resetting the signal handlers.
      Fix parsing of the argument of the -T option.
      Fix race condition between select(2) and signal delivery. If a signal
      is delivered between the start of the main select loop and select might
      wait for a long time. Fixing this with select is not possible so switch
      to pselect. Unlike select, pselect takes a struct timespec pointer as
      its argument so rewrite the related infrastructure to work with struct
      timespec instead of struct timeval. For now the race did only affect the
      SIGQUIT delivery.
      Remove unused function writemsg().
      Don't use C++ comments.
      Remove unused definition of MAXCMDLEN.
      The curses terminal connection displays the destination call in the
      upper left. The call comes from commandline arg. Ensure to write it in
      upper case.
      Fix use of glibc feature selection macros. __USE_XOPEN should not be
      used directly by application code. Other feature selection macros must
      be defined before inclusion of any system header files.
      Fix possible buffer overflow. When downloading a file with a very long
      filename the 80 byte buffer used by start_ab_download() might
      overflow. Increase the buffer to a sufficient size and switch to using
      snprintf for double safety.
      Remove unused arguments from sevenplname()
  * ax25ipd:
      Replace bzero use with memset. bzero is a mega-ancient use of bsdism.
      Remove code for ICMP mode. Supposedly it didn't work and it was never
      being built anyway.
      Fix glibc feature selection macros.
      Get rid of __bsdi__ ifdefery. I don't think this was ever meant to run
      on a BSD/i386 or BSD/OS system.
      Remove USE_SGTTY ifdefery.
      USE_TERMIOS is never defined.
      USE_TERMIO is always defined.
      Add support for all Linux-supported bit rates. For all Linux-supported
      architectures this adds support for: 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800,
      500000, 576000, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000,
      3500000 and 4000000 bits per second.
      For SPARC this also adds support for: 76800, 153600, 307200, 614400 and
      921600 bits per second.
      As before 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800,
      9600, 19200 and 38400 remain supported.
      Fix stats. The stats structure was defined in the ax25ipd.h header as a
      static variable resulting in each compilation unit having its own stats
      variable. The sole reader, the do_stats() function would thus only see
      and print all-zero stats.
      Make function do_stats() static. It's only being used from within
      ax25ipd.c.
      Make function greet_world() static. It's only being used from within
      ax25ipd.c. To avoid the need for a prototype within ax25ipd.c move the
      function above its first caller.
      Remove pointless prototype for main().
      Sort out prototypes for hupper(). There were two - and they can be
      avoided entirely.
      Sort out prototypes for usr1_handler(). Make usr1_handler() static,
      remove its prototype from the header and reorder code to avoid prototypes.
      Sort out prototypes for int_handler().
      Sort out prototype for term_handler().
      Sort out prototype for io_error(). io_error() has no callers outside its
      defining file.

ax25apps (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix segfault in listen. initscr() must be called before has_colors()
  is checked. Also changed warning to print to stderr when no color
  support found if color support requested.

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Mon, 01 Dec 2014 12:00:00 -0800

ax25apps (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating source to sync with upstream official source

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 -0800

ax25apps (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed ax25ipd to be a little less verbose in the log files (per F6BVP)
  * Changed ax25ipd to better check control byte (see Debian bug #606338)

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Tue, 31 Jul 2012 14:00:00 -0800

ax25apps (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverted ax25ipd to compile with -DTERMIO vs. -DTERMIOS. Using the latter
  causes ax25ipd to randomly send garbage traffic on some platforms.

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Mon, 12 Sep 2011 20:30:00 -0800

ax25apps (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the spec file to handle different dependency names for Mandriva

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Mon, 14 Feb 2011 10:30:00 -0800

ax25apps (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the package name to ax25apps from ax25-apps since the '-' really makes
  creating binary packages a pain (does not comply with most policies)
  * Changed the way version is parsed in configure.ac to be passed to the rpm
  spec file.
  * Changed the spec file to install the package in the proper places as well
  as the URL's to point to here. Also added dependency checking.

 -- Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org>  Sun, 30 Jan 2011 11:00:00 -0800

ax25-apps (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
  * This package has been in beta for so long, it is time to release version 1.0.0.
  * Cleaned up source directories, put the docs, conf files, and mans
  in their own folders
  * Rebuilt the configure.ac re-checking dependencies
  * Fixed the configure.ac so the rpm building support works
  * Updated configure to use current GNU autotools
  * Used CVS code (Jan 12 2011) for ax25rtd, ax25mond, call, listen and
  used patched source from Bernard Pidoux for ax25ipd
  * ax25ipd now supports:
  *dynamic DNS hosts (Steve Fraser vk5asf, Jun 2005)
  *ability to route packets over axip links that are not from the
  gateway callsign (Cathryn Mataga)
  *integrates the dynamic DNS patch and uses mutex and threads
  if DNS fails on start, route is set to 0 and rechecked about an
  hour later (Cathryn Mataga)
  *ax25ipd.conf now supports additional flags l and p (Cathryn Mataga)
  * ax25ipd should route as before, except in the case when packets
  not from the callsign of the route but from the same IP would
  have gone to the default route, they now will go to the
  ip from which they originate.
  * Default baud rate for ax25ipd is 9600bps. Present version supports 19200
  and 38400 as well, but any invalid rate will default to 9600. Change compile
  flags to use TERMIOS instead of TERMIO which is obsolete. (Lee W.)
  * Add support for ax25ipd to use baud rates up to 115200. (Lee W.)
  * Removed previous patch that closes stderr and stdout, not required to use Unix98
  pty's. Now we get logging and status again when run as a daemon! (Lee W.)
  * ax25ipd version incremented (Lee W.)

ax25-apps (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New rosedump.c from Jean-Paul.
  * Changes to ax25rtd from Hubert F5LCT for problems with
  kernel 2.2.13.
  * Fix for ax25rtd in VC mode
  * Patch from Hans to work better with newer GCCs
  * doc dirs are now relocatable
  * Added Jens patches
  Adapted ax25rtd to new kernel-ax25. ax25-learn-only-mine has
  to be set to "true" for all interfaces to work right now.
  Note that this is only a temporary solution.
  Made new-ax25-stack ready (listen, ax25rtd). Will still work
  with old kernel-AX25 but need recompile.
  * New program, ax25mond
