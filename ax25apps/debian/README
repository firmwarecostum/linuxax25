The Debian Package ax25apps
----------------------------

This version is a modified version of the CVS source from
http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page

It re-arranges the source code in to proper directorys, updates to
current autotools, corrects build dependencies, and adds some bug fixes.

Until the modified source makes it into CVS, it will be available
from https://github.com/ve7fet/linuxax25

***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need
the following additional packages installed:
        libtool
        dpkg-dev
        debhelper
        devscripts
        fakeroot
        lintian
        dh-make

From inside the source folder (ax25apps), run the following:
        ./autogen.sh
        debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
        fakeroot debian/rules clean
        ./autogen.sh clean

Note, you can build a package on a Pi if you want to make armhf packages 
instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if you like).
