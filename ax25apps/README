AX25 Apps
========

ax25ipd is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
       Steve Fraser vk5asf, introduced in Jun 2005 supporting of dynamic DNS hosts
       additionally Cathryn Mataga added ability to route packets over axip links 
       that are not from the gateway callsign.
       Read more information in related ChangeLog.

ax25ipd supports baud rates of 57600 and 115200. Previous versions (<1.1.0) will
       default to 9600 if:
	* your system does not support rates >9600
	* if you try and set a speed >38400

This WILL cause problems if you are configured to use >38400 and are using THIS version
of ax25ipd (>=1.1.0) to communicate with an older version that "thinks" it is
configured to use a speed >38400 (since it will default to 9600).

Note that this only affects serial communications and not IP/UDP.

Listen now by default is NOT setuid root which means that normal users will
not be able to run it out of the box.  If you want everyone to run
listen then after installing the binaries as root type
  chmod u+s /usr/bin/listen
This version includes support for Mat DG2FEF's new AX.25 subsystem. Binaries
are not interchangeable but require recompile.
