AX25 Apps
========

***Building from Source***

To build this package from a source tarball, you need the following:
	A GNU/Linux system
	autoconf
	automake
	libtool
	libc
	gcc

On a Debian/Ubuntu, or similar system, you would need at least the following 
packages:
	autotools-dev 
	autoconf 
	automake 
	libncursesw5-dev

Quick and dirty build, with all the defaults, can be accomplished with:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

This will typically install everything under /usr/local. If you want it 
installed elsewhere, see the INSTALL file for options you can pass to 
the ./configure script.


***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need 
the following additional packages installed:
	libtool 
	dpkg-dev 
	debhelper 
	devscripts 
	fakeroot 
	lintian 
	dh-make 

From inside the source folder (ax25apps), run the following:
	./autogen.sh
	debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
	fakeroot debian/rules clean
	./autogen.sh clean

Note, you can build a package on a Pi if you want to make armhf packages 
instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if you like).


***Sample Config Files***

By default, the sample config files will be installed in:
        /usr/local/share/doc/ax25apps/conf

You would typically copy them to /usr/local/etc/ax25 and modify them
to fit your needs.

If you installed the software from a binary package, then the sample
files likely are in /usr/share/doc/ax25apps/conf, and would need to
be moved to /etc/ax25 and modified.

ax25ipd is a custom release, loosely associated with the official source.
       Steve Fraser vk5asf, introduced in Jun 2005 supporting of dynamic DNS hosts
       additionally Cathryn Mataga added ability to route packets over axip links 
       that are not from the gateway callsign.
       Read more information in related ChangeLog.

       We try wherever possible to add patches/bug fixes from the upstream code, 
       however, the official code DOES NOT support some of these features.

ax25ipd now supports ALL standard Linux baud rates. Previous versions (<1.1.0) will
       default to 9600 if:
	* your system does not support rates >9600
	* if you try and set a speed >38400

This WILL cause problems if you are configured to use >38400 and are using THIS version
of ax25ipd (>=1.1.0) to communicate with an older version that "thinks" it is
configured to use a speed >38400 (since it will default to 9600).

Note that this only affects serial communications and not IP/UDP.

Listen now by default is NOT setuid root which means that normal users will
not be able to run it out of the box.  If you want everyone to run
listen then after installing the binaries as root type
  chmod u+s /usr/bin/listen
This version includes support for Mat DG2FEF's new AX.25 subsystem. Binaries
are not interchangeable but require recompile.
