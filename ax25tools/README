AX25 Tools
==========
Note that kissattch has changed its command line format slight.  While the
old format will work, the -i option is now, err, not optional.  This was
done to stop the million or so emails we get on linux-hams email list
saying why do people get axports unconfigured even after a kissattach 
command.

***Building from Source***

To build this package from a source tarball, you need the following:
        A GNU/Linux system
        autoconf
        automake
        libtool
        libc
        gcc

On a Debian/Ubuntu, or similar system, you would need at least the following
packages:
        autotools-dev
        autoconf
        automake
        libtool
        zlib1g-dev
        libncursesw5-dev

Quick and dirty build, with all the defaults, can be accomplished with:
        ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

This will typically install everything under /usr/local. If you want it
installed elsewhere, see the INSTALL file for options you can pass to
the ./configure script.


***Sample Config Files***

By default, the sample config files will be installed in:
        /usr/local/share/doc/ax25tools/conf

You would typically copy them to /usr/local/etc/ax25 and modify them
to fit your needs.

If you installed the software from a binary package, then the sample
files likely are in /usr/share/doc/ax25tools/conf, and would need to
be moved to /etc/ax25 and modified.
