AX25 Tools
==========
Note that kissattch has changed its command line format slight.  While the
old format will work, the -i option is now, err, not optional.  This was
done to stop the million or so emails we get on linux-hams email list
saying why do people get axports unconfigured even after a kissattach 
command.

***Building from Source***

To build this package from a source tarball, you need the following:
        A GNU/Linux system
        autoconf
        automake
        libc
        gcc

On a Debian/Ubuntu, or similar system, you would need at least the following
packages:
        autotools-dev
        autoconf
        automake
        zlib1g-dev

Quick and dirty build, with all the defaults, can be accomplished with:
        ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

This will typically install everything under /usr/local. If you want it
installed elsewhere, see the INSTALL file for options you can pass to
the ./configure script.


***Building the X-related Utilities***

By default, there will be no attempt to build the X-related utilities, 
even if all the dependencies exist.

To build the X-related utilities (in fl), you will need to explicitly 
add the --with-xutils option to ./configure.

In addition, you will need (on Debian/Ubuntu) the following packages, and all 
their associated dependencies:
	libx11-dev
	libfltk1.3-dev


***Building a Debian Package***

To build a Debian (Ubuntu) package from this source tarball, you will need 
the following additional packages installed:
	libtool 
	dpkg-dev 
	debhelper 
	devscripts 
	fakeroot 
	lintian 
	dh-make 

From inside the source folder (ax25tools), run the following:
	./autogen.sh
	debuild -us -uc

That should build a set of un-signed packages (.deb) in the parent folder.

To clean up/start over, the following commands are useful:
	fakeroot debian/rules clean
	./autogen.sh clean

Note, you can build a package on a Pi if you want to make armhf packages 
instead (or do it in a cross-compiler, if you like).


***Sample Config Files***

By default, the sample config files will be installed in:
        /usr/local/share/doc/ax25tools/conf

You would typically copy them to /usr/local/etc/ax25 and modify them
to fit your needs.

If you installed the software from a binary package, then the sample
files likely are in /usr/share/doc/ax25tools/conf, and would need to
be moved to /etc/ax25 and modified.
