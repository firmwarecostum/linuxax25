ax25tools (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing the default conf file installation. Correct the file names and
  variable substitution. We will install in etc/ax25 by default, but
  on an upgrade, the conf files will be installed with a .dist extension,
  so they don't clobber existing user files.
  * Added better header file checking to configure script. Now aborts on
  missing headers.
  * Update Debian packaging files to compatibility level 10.
  * Remove the distribution/dependency on the SVNREV file, which is
  not currently used.

ax25tools (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add files to build Debian packages.
  * Reformat ChangeLog for consisency.
  * Change the way the default conf files are installed. They will now be
  put in somewhere like /usr/share/doc/ax25apps/conf with .dist extensions
  to ensure that the default config files don't clobber working files.
  * This update includes nearly all patches in the official source between
  2015 and 2017, to make the two source trees consistent once again.
  * The following changes are from the official source tree:
  * Security fixes in axparms.c, mkiss.c, m6pack.c, nrparms.c, and
  rsparms.c (printf/fprintf formatting) found when compiling
  with -Werror=format-security.
  * Tree-wide delete duplicate #includes.
  * Tree-wide remove casrs of a type to the same type.
  * Tree-wide remove useless casts of a function return value to void.
  * Tree-wide remove useless casts from bind() pointer argument.
  * Tree-wide remove useless casts from memset pointer argument.
  * Tree-wide remove useless casts from memcpy pointer argument.
  * Tree-wide kill assignments in if conditions.
  * Tree-wide white space changes for consistency.
  * Tree-wide fix signedness compiler warnings.
  * Tree-wide make many functions and variables static.
  * Various programs Remove support for !defined(__GLIBC__) and __GLIBC__ != 2.
  * Various programs use the right way to get the required feature set from 
  glibc. __USE_XOPEN doesn't work to get ptsname() etc. from libc. This is
  Linux-specific software so convert to _GNU_SOURCE.
  * mheard: added "-d a" option to mheard. Display the data from c and s
  combined in one view. Requires wide screen.
  * mheard: fix for segfault issue,port record data can be garbled. We cannot
  trust the data. i.e., ctime() returns NULL at time_t 2^33 (72057594037927936).
  char lh[] was size 30. This is not enough for year > 999999999. Also assure
  that pr->entry.type is < sizeof(types), and in 'case 4:', only up to 8
  digipeaters are copied.
  * mheard: changed printf to %u (because mheard's struct has unsigned int
  values) and enhanced formating (%8 instead of %5).
  * mheard: got rid of ctime() and using localtime()/strftime(). Has nicer
  time representation, too.
  * mheard: drop unsatisfiable conditions.
  * beacon: new option -f, do not fork.
  * beacon: new option -H, beacon intervals relative to the hour
  * axspawn: found Debian Wheezy useradd bug, useradd terminates and
  eats 100% cpu power, if it was called from axspawn. This could be prevented
  if SIGCHLD is masked.
  * axspawn: to increase security, no longer call useradd via system() but
  fork() and execve().
  * axspawn: fixed a bug when useradd failed then the login process continued
  anyway.
  * axspawn: empty lines in axspawn.conf are now valid.
  * axspawn: the user_shell config variable is optional. If not specified,
  /bin/bash is used. Except, if create_with_useradd is configured and there's
  a config file /etc/default/useradd, then it's not passed to useradd in
  order to let him choose.
  * axspawn: remove unused variable command.
  * axspawn: sort out pointer signedness mess.
  * axspawn: sort out homebrew declaration of forkpty(3).
  * axspawn: remove unused function Xtoupper().
  * ax25d: security patch submitted by Jaroslav Skarvada <jskarvad@redhat.com>
  Netrom and ROSE Addresses are copied to Node. Room was enough for Netrom,
  but rose addresses returned by rose_ntoa() are one byte longer (a 10 bytes
  string plus null-termination) which leads to a buffer overflow.
  * ax25d: fix warning about set but unused variable. This is from dead code
  setting the no-op socket option AX25_IAMDIGI.
  * ax25d: reorder code to avoid the need for forward declarations. And then
  delete those now useless declarations.
  * access: move calc_md5_pw to eleminate need for declaration and make static.
  * axgetput: fixed regression in axgetput (bget/bput crc was calculated wrong)
  * axgetput: provide calc_crc() function to iterate over memory area.
  * axgetput: use shifts instead of a silly table to compute bitmask.
  * axgetput: move definition of several array from a .h to a .c file. And
  add proper declarations to the header file.
  * axgetput: don't check for negative return from strlen. For one, strlen
  does not return any errors. By its very nature, strlen does not return
  negative results and its return type is size_t which happens to be unsigned.
  * hdlcutil: remove HDRVC_KERNEL ifdefery. HDRVC_KERNEL was always defined
  to on.
  * hdlcutil: remove undocumented user mode.
  * sethdlc: remove HDRVC_KERNEL ifdefery. HDRVC_KERNEL was always defined
  to on.
  * xfhdlcst: remove HDRVC_KERNEL ifdefery. HDRVC_KERNEL was always defined
  to on.
  * kissnetd: fix possible buffer overflow. When printing an error message for
  configurations using particularly long file names a buffer overflow may occur
  potencially resulting in malfunction or crash.
  * kissnetd: fix swapped calloc arguments. Fortunately this is a harmless 
  issue.
  * mkiss: change type of buffer[] to fix warning.
  * net2kiss: switch from private openpty() implementation to libutil. In
  particular the openpty() implementation was still using only the old BSD
  terminals so not working on modern distributions which ship their kernels
  with CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS disabled.
  * netromr: fix warning by moving declaration of variable `compliant'.
  * netromt: fix warning about set but unused variable.
  * netromt: use symbolic pathnames from pathnames.h.
  * netromt: add cast to fix warning.
  * rsattach: the current linux kernel has no limit anymore for the number
  of netrom and rose devices (previously 4 netrom, 6 rose).
  * rsdwnlnk: make alarm_handler() static.
  * rsdwnlnk: add cast to silence useless warning.
  * rsmemsiz: move /proc filename defines to pathnames.h.
  * rsmemsiz: use standard libc function to get load average.
  * rsmemsiz: when parsing /proc/uptime, ignore idle time. We don't use this
  information anyway later on.
  * rsmemsiz: use sysinfo to obtain uptime. Now that uptime() is only used to
  obtain the load average it's trivial to replace.
  * rsmemsiz: delete now unused macro SET_IF_DESIRED.
  * rsmemsiz: rewrite the last instance of FILE_TO_BUF(). Expand the one
  remaining invocation to FILE_TO_BUF(), then fix the return type and attempt
  to close fd -1 and format nicely.
  * rsmemsiz: fix warning and add error check to getuptime call.
  * rip98d: change mask2bits's argument from unsigned long to unsigned int. An
  IPv4 address or mask fits into an unsigned int.
  * rip98d: change bits2mask's return value from unsigned long to unsigned int.
  An IPv4 mask fit into an unsigned int.
  * rip98d: replace naive mask2bits and bits2mask implementations.
  * rip98d: perform a crapectomy on hex2intrev(). hex2intrev is a hilariously
  complicated function which combine parsing a hexadecimal integer in network
  byte order and swapping the result to host byte order.
  * rip98d: move the endianness swapping to the caller which allows us to remove
  double endianness swapping. Now that hex2intrev no longer deals with byte
  order rename it to hex2int and replace its implementation with a simple
  invocation of strtoul.
  * rip98r: replace naive mask2bits and bits2mask implementations.
  * rip98r: use unsigned int to store IPv4 addresses and masks. Unsigned long
  is wasteful on 64 bit.
  * user_io: fix warning about void pointer arithmetic.
  * mcs2h: fix warning about set but unused variable.
  * mcs2h: fix warning about format string.
  * mcs2h: make functions static and delete unused function.
  * yamcfg: fix warning about format string.

ax25-tools (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
  * This package has been beta for so long, it is time to relase version 1.0.0.
  * Moved axports, nrports, and rsports example config files to this
  package from libax25. They should be in here where their associated
  utilities reside (kissattach, nrattach, rsattach, etc), not in the
  library distribution.
  * Moved the related mans axports.5, nrports.5, and rsports.5 into this
  package from libax25. The conf files are here, so the man pages had
  to come too.
  * Re-organized the package to put the /etc and /man files in their
  own build directories.
  * Put misc README's in /doc
  * Re-checked build dependencies and updated configure.ac for:
