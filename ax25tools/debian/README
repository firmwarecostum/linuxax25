The Debian Package ax25tools
----------------------------

This version is a modified version of the January 2011 CVS source
from http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page

It re-arranges the source code in to proper directorys, updates to
current autotools, corrects build dependencies, and installs the
conf files from libax25.

Until the modified source makes it into CVS, it will be available
from https://github.com/ve7fet/linuxax25
