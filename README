This is NOT the official Linux AX.25 software suite (libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools). 
The official home is hosted by the Linux Ham group at https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de/wiki/Main_Page That is where official development should take place.

However Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org> performed a remarkable job reorganizing AX.25 suite in order to facilitate packaging on many distro. Lee also fixed a number of bugs.

***Building from Source***
See the "Releases" link on this page to download the current source tarballs.


***Debian Package Building***
You should be able to build a Debian package (.deb) for any of libax25 (will also build a -dev package with header files), ax25tools, or ax25apps.
 
You will need the necessary Debian package building tools installed.

From inside the chosen folder, run "debuild -us -uc" to build an un-signed package.

Other useful commands are:
fakeroot debian/rules clean
fakeroot debian/rules build

Note that the libax25 package conflicts with some files found in libc6-dev. The offending
files are:
        netax25/ax25.h
        netrose/rose.h
        netrom/netrom.h

Those files belong to libax25, and as such, this package is marked to replace
them. Those files will be overwritten by the ones found in the libax25-dev
package.
