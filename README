This is NOT the official Linux AX.25 software suite (libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools). 
The official home is hosted by the Linux Ham group at http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page That is where official development should take place.

However Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org> performed a remarkable job reorganizing AX.25 suite in order to facilitate packaging on many distro. Lee also fixed a number of bugs.
