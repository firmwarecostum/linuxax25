This is NOT the official Linux AX.25 software suite (libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools). 
The official home is hosted by the Linux Ham group at https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de/wiki/Main_Page That is where official development should take place.

However Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org> performed a remarkable job reorganizing AX.25 suite in order to facilitate packaging on many distro. Lee also fixed a number of bugs.

***Building from Source***
See the "Releases" link on this page to download the current source tarballs.

If you are building from source, you will likely need to install the following packages (or their equivalent on your distro):

build-essential
zlib1g-dev
libncursesw5-dev
autotools-dev
autoconf
automake
libtool
m4

For further information, see the README contained in each of the libax25, ax25apps, and ax25tools folders.


***Debian Package Building***
You should be able to build a Debian package (.deb) for any of libax25 (will also build a -dev package with header files), ax25tools, or ax25apps.
 
You will need the necessary Debian package building tools installed.

From inside the chosen folder, run "debuild -us -uc" to build an un-signed package.

Other useful commands are:
fakeroot debian/rules clean
fakeroot debian/rules build

Note that the libax25 package conflicts with some files found in libc6-dev. The offending
files are:
        netax25/ax25.h
        netrose/rose.h
        netrom/netrom.h

Those files belong to libax25, and as such, this package is marked to replace
them. Those files will be overwritten by the ones found in the libax25-dev
package.
